In this project we were tasked to make a portfolio using our new knowledge of CSS. The page need links that would go into 3 sections which are as follows: 
1)Project list
2)About me
3)Contact

When you create a project list you should be able to click on images that will take you to the deployed projects. We currently do not have any so I put a link that goes to my github page. I also added a hover function and a slight highlight when hovering over.

I was able to include a picture of myself in the about me with some information. As well for my contact which has a link to my linkedin profile.

The one thing I was not able to do was make the page responsive which was needed. My images for my project are able to move when resizing but everything else just stays in place. It's suppose to move together but I was not able to figure it out.

Over all the page has the required information and it could look nicer.
